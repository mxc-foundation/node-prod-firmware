port = TBD (at the moment: 0x01)

Quick experiments with Gimasi's Loraduino/Tuino cloud suggest
that the maximum payload length is 0x33 (51) bytes.

Payload is consisting of several commands in a Type-Length-Value
(TLV) format.  The first byte is consisting of Type (bits [7:4]),
defining the command, and Length (bits [3:0]), the length of the
arguments in bytes.  If the Length bits are 0xF (binary 1111),
the command has its length specified in bits [5:0] of the second
byte.

Downlink commands are as follows:

Number	Name		Length	Description
------	----		------	-----------

0	Get/set params	1	Get parameter described by first
				byte.
			>=2	Set parameter described by first
				byte to the value specified in
				the rest of the message.

				Parameters are as follows:

				param	len	description
				0	6	DevEUI-48 and BLE
						MAC address (MSBF)
				1	8	AppEUI-64 (MSBF)
				2	16	AppKey
						(write-only)
				3	1	Sensor period:
						0	default
						1	10 sec
						2	30 sec
						3	 1 min
						4	 2 min
						5	 5 min
						6	10 min
						7	30 min
						8	 1 hour
						9	 2 hours
						10	 5 hours
						11	12 hours
				4	1	Minimal LoRa Spread Factor
						Valid values: 7-12

				Parameters 0, 1, 2 and 4 are
				actualized after reboot.

1	Reboot/Upgrade	0	Reboot the mote immediately.
			1	Reboot the mote after the
				specified timeout; optionally
				turn BLE and SUOTA on for
				upgrades.  The argument is as
				follows:
				bit [7]:
					0	just reboot
					1	BLE on
				bits [6:3]:
						Reserved
				bits [2:0]:
					0	TBD
					1	5 minutes
					2	15 minutes
					3	30 minutes
					4	1 hour
					5	2 hours
					6	4 hours
					7	TBD

Uplink reports are as follows:

Number	Name		Length	Description
------	----		------	-----------
0	Param value	>=2	Response to the "Get params"
				command.  The first byte is the
				param number, the rest are the
				value.
1	Sensor data	>=1	Sensor data.
2	Battery level	1	Battery level in 10mV steps from
				2V (0 = 2V, 255 = 4.55V).

Sensor data consists of a byte signifying the sensor type, as
defined in sensor.c, and zero or more bytes of sensor data.  The
defined types and corresponding data formats are:

Number	Name	Data length	Description
------	----	-----------	-----------
0	Unknown	0		No data.
1	GPS	1 or 11		Node moved or GPS coordinates.
2	Temp	1 or 2		Temperature.

GPS data format is as follows:

When data length is 1:

Offset	Length	Description
------	------	-----------
0	1	Indicates whether the node has moved since last
		GPS fix.  Possible values are:
		0	Node is stable since last GPS fix
		1	Node has moved, or has not received a GPS
			fix since boot; waiting for GPS fix

When data length is 11:

Offset	Length	Description
------	------	-----------
0	1	$GPGGA Position Fix Indicator.  Possible values
		are:
		0	Fix not available or invalid
		1	GPS SPS Mode, fix valid
		2	Differential GPS, SPS Mode, fix valid
		6	Dead Reckoning Mode, fix valid
1	4	Lattitude in 1/1000 of minutes, as little-endian
		int32.  Positive is north, negative is south.  To
		get the value in degrees, divide by 600000.
5	4	Longitude in 1/1000 of minutes, as little-endian
		int32.  Positive is east, negative is west.  To
		get the value in degrees, divide by 600000.
9	2	Altitude above geoid mean sea level in decimetres
		(0.1m), as little-endian int16.

The format of GPS data is subject to change.

Temperature data is 1 or 2 bytes.  The format is as follows:

Offset	Length	Description
------	------	-----------
0	1	Temperature in degrees Celsius as a signed
		int8_t, giving the range between -128 and +127.
		Temperatures outside this range are not sent.
1	1	If present, fractional temperature in 1/256th
		degrees Celsius as a unsigned uint8_t.  Typically
		only the most significant 3 bits hold a value.
